# Elm-Media

An experimental Elm wrapper for the HTML5 Media API.

## Getting Started

This project includes native code, so unless it gets white-listed by the powers that be, it will have to be installed manually.

I recommend using [elm-github-install](https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-github-install).
